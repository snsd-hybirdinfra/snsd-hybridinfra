## Overview

This scenario documents cloud instance recovery automation within the cloud instance operational
domain. It focuses on cloud instance, VM, host resource, instance status check and demonstrates how
infrastructure operations teams can use domain-specific telemetry, lifecycle workflow design, and
evidence-backed validation to support execute controlled recovery, restoration, failover, or
mitigation workflow.

---

## Objectives

- Define the scenario-specific cloud instance signal represented by cloud-instance-recovery-automation.
- Identify the affected cloud instance components and dependencies.
- Collect and interpret telemetry from cloud instance, VM, host resource, instance status check.
- Use health status as an operational signal for detection or validation.
- Use availability signal as an operational signal for detection or validation.
- Use latency as an operational signal for detection or validation.
- Document the lifecycle workflow from detection through validation.
- Produce reviewer-readable evidence artifacts for portfolio assessment.

1. Detection
2. Correlation and Analysis
3. Incident Coordination
4. Recovery and Automation
5. Recovery Validation
6. Governance and Reporting

---

## Detection Workflow

health status; availability signal; latency; error indicator; event log; metric threshold

---

## Correlation and Analysis

Correlate cloud instance signals with related infrastructure state, dependencies, recent events, and
service impact.

---

## Alert and Incident Workflow

Execute controlled recovery, restoration, failover, or mitigation workflow

---

## Recovery and Automation Workflow

Execute controlled recovery, restoration, failover, or mitigation workflow

---

## Recovery Validation

Validate stable state, evidence completeness, and operational readiness after detection, analysis,
response, or recovery.

---

## Monitoring and Visibility

Monitoring and visibility include health status; availability signal; latency; error indicator;
event log; metric threshold.
