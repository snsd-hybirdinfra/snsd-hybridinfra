# SNSD Hybrid Infrastructure Portfolio

This repository is a scenario-driven infrastructure operations portfolio.

It demonstrates how infrastructure is built, monitored, analyzed, recovered, validated, and prepared for continuity review through structured build scenarios, operational scenarios, reusable capability modules, and diagram rendering tools.

---

## Repository Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `builds/` | Infrastructure build scenarios |
| `modules/` | Reusable infrastructure and operational capability modules |
| `scenarios/` | Lifecycle-based operational scenarios |
| `tools/diagram-renderer/` | Operational poster rendering tool |
| `reports/` | Generated scenario data maps and review outputs |

---

## Portfolio Model

The portfolio is organized around four layers:

Build Scenarios  
→ Capability Modules  
→ Operational Scenarios  
→ Evidence and Diagrams

Build scenarios show how infrastructure foundations are created.

Capability modules define reusable operational and infrastructure capabilities.

Operational scenarios demonstrate lifecycle-based infrastructure operations workflows.

Diagram and evidence artifacts support reviewer-readable portfolio validation.

---

## Operational Lifecycle

Operational scenarios are organized by lifecycle level.

| Level | Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Level 1 | `scenarios/level-1-visibility/` | Visibility, monitoring, and telemetry detection |
| Level 2 | `scenarios/level-2-correlation/` | Correlation, dependency analysis, and impact reasoning |
| Level 3 | `scenarios/level-3-recovery/` | Recovery, automation, restoration, and validation |
| Level 4 | `scenarios/level-4-resilience/` | Resilience, failover, distributed survivability |
| Level 5 | `scenarios/level-5-continuity/` | Enterprise continuity, governance, and executive reporting |

---

## Build Scenarios

Build scenarios document infrastructure creation and readiness preparation.

Examples include:

- Hybrid VPC foundation
- Private web tier with bastion access
- NAT gateway egress architecture
- ALB-based web service routing
- Security boundary baseline
- Observability stack deployment
- Ansible server bootstrap
- Log pipeline foundation
- Backup automation foundation
- Recovery validation lab

See `builds/`.

---

## Capability Modules

Modules represent reusable infrastructure and operational capability boundaries.

Examples include:

- Infrastructure Provisioning Module
- Network Foundation Module
- Compute Foundation Module
- Security Baseline Module
- Observability Foundation Module
- Telemetry Aggregation Module
- Dependency Correlation Module
- Recovery Orchestration Module
- Validation Reporting Module
- Continuity Governance Module

See `modules/`.

---

## Operational Scenarios

Operational scenarios are lifecycle-based workflows that demonstrate how infrastructure conditions are detected, analyzed, coordinated, recovered, validated, and reviewed.

Each scenario README includes:

- Scenario metadata
- Overview
- Objectives
- Used modules
- Used adapters
- Infrastructure components
- Detection workflow
- Correlation and analysis
- Incident or response workflow
- Recovery and validation workflow
- Evidence links
- Related scenarios

See `scenarios/`.

---

## Diagram Renderer

The diagram renderer generates operational poster artifacts for selected scenarios.

Renderer location:

`tools/diagram-renderer/`

The renderer is kept separate from scenario content generation so that visual artifacts can evolve independently from README and metadata content.

---

## Current Content Model

Scenario content is generated from a scenario data map.

reports/scenario-required-data-map.csv  
→ scenarios/*/*/metadata.yaml  
→ scenarios/*/*/README.md

This prevents scenario READMEs from becoming generic copies of each other.

Each scenario is classified by:

- Lifecycle level
- Primary operational domain
- Target resource
- Telemetry signals
- Infrastructure components
- Detection inputs
- Correlation context
- Response or recovery workflow
- Validation actions
- Used modules
- Used adapters

---

## Portfolio Purpose

This repository is designed to show practical infrastructure engineering capability across:

- Infrastructure build design
- Hybrid infrastructure operations
- Monitoring and visibility
- Dependency correlation
- Recovery automation
- Resilience coordination
- Continuity governance
- Evidence-backed technical documentation

---

## Summary

SNSD Hybrid Infrastructure Portfolio demonstrates how infrastructure foundations and operational workflows can be organized into a reviewer-readable engineering portfolio.

The repository connects build scenarios, reusable capability modules, lifecycle-based operational scenarios, and diagram artifacts into a coherent infrastructure operations model.
