## Overview

This scenario documents virtual machine restoration within the virtual machine operational domain.
It focuses on virtual machine, hypervisor, guest OS, compute host and demonstrates how
infrastructure operations teams can use domain-specific telemetry, lifecycle workflow design, and
evidence-backed validation to support execute controlled recovery, restoration, failover, or
mitigation workflow.

---

## Objectives

- Define the scenario-specific virtual machine signal represented by virtual-machine-restoration.
- Identify the affected virtual machine components and dependencies.
- Collect and interpret telemetry from virtual machine, hypervisor, guest OS, compute host.
- Use health status as an operational signal for detection or validation.
- Use availability signal as an operational signal for detection or validation.
- Use latency as an operational signal for detection or validation.
- Document the lifecycle workflow from detection through validation.
- Produce reviewer-readable evidence artifacts for portfolio assessment.

## Alert and Incident Workflow

Execute controlled recovery, restoration, failover, or mitigation workflow

---

## Recovery and Automation Workflow

Execute controlled recovery, restoration, failover, or mitigation workflow

---

## Recovery Validation

response, or recovery.

---

## Monitoring and Visibility

Monitoring and visibility include health status; availability signal; latency; error indicator;
event log; metric threshold.
